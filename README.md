## ⚙️ Working Principle
1. The ultrasonic sensor measures the distance between the sensor and the water surface.
2. ESP8266 calculates the water level from the measured distance.
3. Based on predefined thresholds:
   - Pump turns **ON** when water level is low.
   - Pump turns **OFF** when the tank is full.
4. Water level data and pump status are sent to the **Blynk IoT app**.
5. Users can monitor water level and control the pump remotely.
